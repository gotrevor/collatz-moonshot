# Amusical permutation: looking for a single-chain mechanism (2026-10-13)

Target: `AmusicalInfinitelyManyOrbits` (Klamkin 1963, problem (a)).  Odds of settling it in
this lane: low, ~2-3%; it has been open for 63 years and resisted Venturini and Tavares.
This note maps why the obvious tools fail and what a mechanism would have to use.

## 1. U is a full shift on three symbols, restricted to the integers

Let `K = ℤ₂ × ℤ₃`.  Define `Û(a, b)` by reading the branch of `a` (even, `1 mod 4`, `3 mod 4`)
and applying the same rational affine map (`3x/2`, `(3x+1)/4`, `(3x-1)/4`) to both coordinates.

* On `ℤ₂`, each branch maps its clopen piece (measure `1/2, 1/4, 1/4`) homeomorphically onto
  `ℤ₂`, with contracting inverse branches.  So the forward branch sequence codes `ℤ₂`
  homeomorphically onto `{E, A, B}^ℕ`.
* The `ℤ₃` image of branch `E, A, B` lands in `0, 1, 2 mod 3` respectively
  (`even_iff_amusical_mod_three` is the integer case), so `Û` is invertible with inverse reading
  `b mod 3`; on `ℤ₃` the inverse branches `2m, 4m+1, 4m+3` are again a full three-branch coding.
* The future symbols of `(a, b)` depend only on `a` and the past symbols only on `b`.

So `(K, Û)` is topologically conjugate to the two-sided full shift on `{E, A, B}`, and `U` is
its restriction to the diagonal copy of `ℤ`, which is dense and invariant.  In this language:

* **Klamkin (a):** does the diagonal `ℤ` meet infinitely many shift orbits?
* **Orbit of 8:** is the point `ι(8)` aperiodic?
* **Periodic points:** a periodic word `w` of length `p` is the diagonal image of the rational
  fixed point `c_w / (2^|w| − 3^p)` (the same rational affine map on both coordinates), so the
  shift's periodic points are exactly a countable set of rationals with denominators prime to
  `6`, and the cycles of `U` are the periodic words whose rational is an integer
  (Böhm-Sontacchi for `U`).

This is very likely known in Lagarias's conjugacy language; I have not found it stated for the
permutation.  Not formalized (needs `ℤ_[p]` coding machinery).

## 2. Why density, measure and crossing arguments all balance (no-go)

Any argument that also applies to `ℕ` itself, which is a union of infinitely many orbits,
cannot prove there are infinitely many.  All the first-order tools are of that kind:

* **Haar balance.**  `E[1/slope] = (1/2·2/3 + 1/2·4/3)^N = 1`: the 2-adic Haar measure is
  exactly preserved, so Tavares's mass-conservation identity (`ψ = ω` for a bijection) balances
  for `ℕ`.  I checked a Rhin-quantified version of Tavares's Theorem 1: it fails because points
  where `U^N` decreases can drop by up to `(3/4)^N`, and that factor swamps the gain.
* **Conformal measures.**  A `U`-invariant set with residue densities defines a measure on `K`
  with the same Jacobian (`2/3` on `E`, `4/3` on `A, B`) as Haar.  Its density with respect to
  Haar is `Û`-invariant, so under ergodicity it is Haar: an invariant set's residue statistics
  cannot tell one orbit from many.
* **Level crossings.**  Below any level, the drift `+0.0589` per step is exactly paid for by
  up-crossing overshoots plus down-crossing undershoots (a telescoping identity), with about
  `X/6` entries into `[1, X]` in total.  This is consistent for any number of chains.

## 3. What single-chain-ness forces

If there are `k` orbits, all integers `≤ X` lie on `k` chains, so some chain visits at least
`X/k` of them.  Its visits below `X` span an index range of length at least `X/(2k)`.  Since a
chain is the orbit of its minimum `m` (one of finitely many seeds):

> **Finitely many orbits ⇒ some fixed seed `m` has `|U^j m| ≤ C|j|` for infinitely many `j`**
> (in fact for a positive fraction of the times at which it is below each level).

Contrapositive candidate node: if every aperiodic orbit escapes faster than linearly,
`|U^j m| / |j| → ∞` as `j → ±∞`, then infinitely many orbits.  The hypothesis concerns
individual orbits, the same kind of statement as `AmusicalOrbitOfEightInfinite`, only stronger.
So this route turns Klamkin (a) back into the orbit-of-8 wall.  Honest assessment: the
reduction is a pigeonhole, not a mechanism.

A linear-size return `U^j m ≤ Cj` is an approximate `S`-unit relation
`|3^j m + c_w| ≤ Cj · 2^n` with `n ≈ j log₂ 3`, where `c_w` is a signed sum of `~j` terms
`±3^a 2^b`.  Baker-type bounds handle few terms (Simons's m-cycles); here the number of terms
grows with `j`.

## 4. Levers worth a further look (odds of each yielding a real dent)

Test applied to each: does the argument also apply to `ℕ`?  If so it cannot work.


1. **Window minima, upper half (in progress, ~60%).**  `WindowMinDensity L` gives the
   unconditional upper bound `upper density(orbit minima) ≤ δ_L` for every `L`, so
   `≤ p_f · p_b ≈ 0.0498`.  Pure congruence counting; it bounds the number of orbits from
   *above*, not from below.
2. **Time asymmetry: dead (~1%, tested 2026-10-13).**  The drifts `0.0589` forward and `0.0566`
   backward measure the same steps under two densities (2-adic residues forward, 3-adic
   backward), and the Jacobian converts one into the other exactly.  Among integers up to `X`,
   multiples of `3` have share `1/3`; among integers up to `2X/3`, evens have share `1/2`; both
   counts are `X/3`.  The asymmetry balances on `ℕ`, so it cannot separate one chain from many.
3. **Rational height: dead as stated (~1%), with a by-product.**  `Û` preserves the denominator
   `q` of every `x ∈ ℤ_(6)`, so the rationals split into invariant layers `D_q = (1/q)·ℤ`.  On
   numerators, `D_q` carries the permutation `U_q(2n) = 3n`, `U_q(r) = (3r + q)/4` for
   `r ≡ q (mod 4)`, `U_q(r) = (3r − q)/4` for `r ≡ 3q (mod 4)`: the `qx+1`-style relatives of
   Collatz's permutation, with `U_1 = U`.  Every periodic shift word lives in the layer of its
   rational's denominator, a divisor of `2^|w| − 3^p`.  The denominator is the only invariant
   this structure supplies, and it is constant on the integers.
4. **Compare a solvable relative.**  Simons 2022 §5.4: for `P(a, b, c, d)` with `b | d`, there
   are provably infinitely many divergent orbits, because one residue class is forward-invariant
   with strict growth.  `U` has no forward-invariant class (both `×3/2` and `×3/4` branches
   reach every class).  Measuring how far `U` is from having an invariant "growth cone" might
   suggest a weaker invariant.
